# Rengars marketplace

The main repository: [SWA_Rengars](https://github.com/VaSmitka/SWA_Rengars)



## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server
stub. This is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements

Python 3.5.2+

## Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r app/requirements.txt
python3 -m app
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:

```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
#removes the volume of flask app
docker volume rm rengars_marketplace_appdata
# flask container should be always rebuilt
docker-compose build flask
# builds images and rungs them in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

```
